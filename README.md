# Health-Monitoring-System
This is a IoT based project to create a Wearable device for regular monitoring of the vitals of a human body. 
The data is regularly tabulated. 
In the case when several incoming results are unusual, a SOS call is placed to the Emergency contacts.
These features are incorporated in a wearable band.
It allows people to monitor the health statuses of their near and dear ones remotely.
